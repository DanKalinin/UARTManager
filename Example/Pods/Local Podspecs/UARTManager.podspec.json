  "description": "UARTManager presents the UART-communication library over Bluetooth. Some BLE SoCs, such as nRF51 series from Nordic Semiconductor include on-board UART profile which allows to use BLE as UART bus. This profile is presented by UART service and by TX and RX characteristics.\nFeatures:\n* Library provides a complete solution to communicate with Nordic BLE chips over UART.\n* Vendors can implement their own protocol over UART profile using the system of commands and responses to them.\n* Library provides UARTCommand class allowing to easy implement own command system by overriding - isRXPacket:responseToTXPacket: method.\n* Command roundtrip time measurement with up to nanosecond accuracy. Precise system timing functions are used for that.\n* Modern API providing flexible mechanism of callbacks based on blocks, notifications and delegates. It's up to you which pattern to use.",
